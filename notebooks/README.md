# Notebooks

## Overview

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the project. These notebooks focus on analyzing datasets, visualizing key metrics, and generating actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Purpose

The notebooks in this folder are designed to:

- Conduct exploratory data analysis on datasets, such as solar potential data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
- Generate visualizations (e.g., boxplots, bar charts) to explore data distributions and trends.
- Perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis) to assess significant differences across datasets.
- Summarize findings through tables and written observations for clear, actionable insights.

## Directory Structure

- `compare_countries.ipynb`: Compares solar potential metrics (GHI, DNI, DHI) across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Includes boxplots, summary statistics, statistical tests, and a bar chart ranking countries by average GHI.
- Additional notebooks will be added as needed for new analyses or datasets.
